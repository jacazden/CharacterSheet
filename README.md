then update the search functions to reflect the changes to searchable objects.
-include inventory vector in the catalog search.  all objects found in inventory must be removed from working catalog
-modify search to preferentially search internal player catalog/inventory

-rewrite various regex matching sections to use regex search instead of regex match -- -maybe

-write math parser!!!

-delete components from catalog when exiting the program, they're only sometimes declared with new though, so this will be hard :C maybe put in an "allocated" flag.
